The personal blog of Alex Francis.

On May 20th, 2019 I was diagnosed with ALS/MND. I have started writing here in August 2020 while I still can. The disease has taken most of the strength from my hands and arms but I can still use my voice. My voice is becoming weaker, so it's now or never.

I live in Somerset, UK my wife and 2 children. Here is a story from the local press about the impact of my MND diagnosis:
[Somerset Standard article](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/it-like-being-hit-bus-3915519).

I used to love running, particularly ultramarathons. I wrote an article about the loss of running from my life. The uniquely wonderful running magazine Like the Wind [published it](https://www.likethewindmagazine.com/2020/01/09/im-not-runner/).

My wife, Laura, wrote a little about our circumstances for a [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/alex-vs-als).
