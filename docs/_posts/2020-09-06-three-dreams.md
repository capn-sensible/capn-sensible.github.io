I have been remembering dreams more frequently in the last months than ever before. Sometimes they are quite entertaining, for me at least. The following 3 happened over a couple of days.

### 1: Woman with a tail

I'm out somewhere with my wife. We meet a woman who we vaguely know. She is very tall, with a big frame. She is awkward. She wears heeled shoes and jeans and... has a tail. The tail reaches the ground and is covered by denim as though the jeans were made to fit over it. She is excited about having a tail. She wants us to compliment her on it. I am just embarrassed.

### 2: Inside the wave

I am on the shore of a familiar beach near where I grew up. I start swimming out through the waves, backwards on my back. The waves gradually become larger and larger until I realise I am about to swim into a giant wave. I am inside the wave. It is moving and I am moving with it but staying within it. I try to swim out of it but it has a skin, it resists and I cannot push out of it. I'm not scared but I feel I shouldn't be there.

### 3: Golden goddess

I am underwater but near the surface; strong sunlight penetrates the water. A beautiful woman is there with me. We are unclothed. She glows, golden light shines from her. Everything about her is golden, her skin, her hair, her eyes. I feel overwhelming acceptance in her smile and unwavering gaze.
