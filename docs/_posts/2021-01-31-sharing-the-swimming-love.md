Back in December I completed a [fundraising challenge to swim 350m in cold water](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/chilly-swim-2020-alex), raising just short of Â£5000 for the [Motor Neurone Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org/). A lovely freelance journalist called [Liz](https://lizlowe.journoportfolio.com/) attended and wrote up a press release about the event: [Swimmer with motor neurone disease completes cold-water challenge](https://outdoorswimmer.com/news/swimmer-with-motor-neurone-disease-completes-cold-water-challenge) which was picked up by [local](https://www.mnrjournal.co.uk/article.cfm?id=119335&headline=Swimmer%20with%20Motor%20Neurone%20Disease%20completes%20chilly%20challenge&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2020) [papers](http://www.frometimes.co.uk/2021/01/06/charity-winter-swim-raises-5000/).

At the start of January I was interviewed by my friend and GP, Rebecca Hall, about my experience of cold water swimming and the benefits I have enjoyed in light of my MND and in relation to my mental health.
