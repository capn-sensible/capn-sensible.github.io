This month I finished reading [The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17736859-the-story-of-the-human-body) by [Daniel Lieberman](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dlieberman/home). I found it illuminating and convincing.

What I was hoping to get from the book was a more scientifically informed view of currently fashionable ideas such as the Palaeo Diet and Ancestral Living: attempts to try to live more in line with how we are evolved to live, with the hope that it will lead to better "healthspan". This might seem like an odd thing to be interested in for someone who has a terminal illness. However, it was a pre-existing interest of mine, it may well be relevant to my children and it also fits into my somewhat hopeless quest to understand as much as I can about why I have ended up with Motor Neurone Disease.

  - What we are evolved for
    - Movement, probably 10 km per day
    - diet
      - eating a lot of tough vegetables and some meat and fat
      - Not eating lots of carbohydrate
        - especially processed
    - Occasional stress only
    - a lot of leisure
    - working more like 6 hours per day
  - concept of mismatch diseases
  - concept of dysevolution
  - Specific examples of things we are getting wrong
    - not chewing enough tough food... Impacted wisdom teeth and small jaws

Things I can't remember whether he had referred to but would like to write about

  - Dairy
  - Gut Bacteria
  - Neurological conditions
